      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        From a young age, I've always been drawn to music.
        Although I played the violin and sang classicaly in choirs until I was about 15,
        It wasn't until I got my first guitar that I really fell in love with playing music.
        <br />
        After learning as much Green Day on the guitar as I could, a friend asked if I wanted to join his metal band
        as a bassist. This prompted me to get a cheap bass and was the start of my journey into bass playing. I also
        started to compose my own songs, although at this point they were often simple imitations of existing songs.
        <br />
        By the time I got to university and joined Little Moon, I'd realised I liked listening to metal more than
        actually playing it. Uni was also where I was first exposed to electronic music, which opened up a whole new
        world of songwriting for me.
        <br />
        Fast forward to 2017, when I joined my longest-lived band Paulo Post Future (PPF); I met some amazing musicians
        in this band, who also liked to experiment and blur the lines between electronic and indie. My love of synths
        and pedals began and after 4 singles, 1 EP, countless shows (and 1 dodgy contract) later we called it quits.
        <br />
        During my time in PPF, I wrote hundred of ideas of which some were used for the band and some were not. A few
        of these unused ideas became the basis of the first few aptist songs, my solo project. These songs blend organic
        elements like guitar, bass and piano with electronic instruments and atypical features like odd time signatures.
        <br />
        Having learnt a lot from recording and producing aptist songs myself, I wanted to play in a band again and so I
        contacted my old Little Moon guitarist and joined her band, First Swim, as the bassist, and we are currently
        recording and looking to release our first song.
        <br />
        As well as aptist and First Swim, I play a Japanese instrument called the shamisen in my spare time, which I've used
        in the aptist song 'Revolutions'. I also like to code and build things (like this website).

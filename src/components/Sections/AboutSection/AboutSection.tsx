      <p>
        Music has been my favourite hobby since I was young. Aside from music, I like to code and work on projects
        (like this music portfolio), and I am also a keen climber.

        If you're a musician and are looking for some inspiration when songwriting, check out another app I built,
        <a href="https://gimme-a-song-75fdbe92334c.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"> Gimme a Song</a>.
        <br />
        It gives you the perfect starting point for when you're in need of some inspiration.

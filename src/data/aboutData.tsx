    artist: 'aptist',
    text: `My current solo project which merges electronic music with organic elements like guitar and bass,
    as well as atypical features such as odd time signatures.`,
    text2: `When writing a song, I often start with the drums or a guitar riff and then build up the idea
    from there. I try not to worry too much about whether a song is sounding 'electronic' enough.`
  },
  {
    artist: 'First Swim',
    text: `My current band in which I play bass guitar and synth. Rooted in indie and rock,
    we also experiment with drum machines, synth and odd time signatures.`,
    text2: `We are currently recording some songs, and hope to release them very soon.`
  },
  {
    artist: 'Paulo Post Future',
    text: `I played bass guitar in this 5 piece. As we had three guitarists, we played with different textures
    and could avoid the typical lead/rhythm guitar divide. The drums were often a focal point in our songs, as
    our drummer was influenced more by electronic music than rock or indie.`,
    text2: `The name came after flicking through a dictionary in a recording studio. We played many gigs together
    (the biggest artist we supported was Benee, before she went viral in 2020).`
  },
  {
    artist: 'Little Moon',
    text: `My first proper band, I learnt a lot about songwriting and how important it is to write songs
    with an audience in mind. I played bass guitar and some guitar.`,
    text2: `We wrote our first song, Charlie, during our first practice together and came up with the band name
    on the drive back from the practice studio (it was night).`

  {
    artist: 'Shamisen',
    text: `I play a Japanese instrument called the shamisen, which is a three-stringed instrument similar
    in sound to a banjo. I enjoy it as it is a way of playing and listening to non-western music, as Japanese music
    can be very different.`,
    text2: `It's used more and more in modern J-rock and J-pop as it has a loud and distinct sound. Recently, I have
    tried to incorporate it into my aptist songs, as I've not heard it used in an electronic context before.`

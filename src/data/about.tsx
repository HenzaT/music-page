    artist: 'Paulo Post Future',
    text: `I played bass guitar in this 5 piece. As we had three guitarists, we played with different textures
    and eschewed the typical lead/rhythm guitar divide. The drums were often a focal point in our songs, as
    our drummer was influenced more by electronic music than rock or indie. `

    artist: 'Shamisen',
    text: `I play a traditional Japanese instrument called the shamisen, which is a three-stringed instrument similar
    in sound to a banjo. I enjoy it as it is a way of playing/listening to non-western music, as Japanese music
    can be very different. `

    title: 'Into Skies',
    info: `'Electronic Tool' (as in the band, Tool) is probably the best way of describing this song.
            As they're one of my favourite bands, I wanted to write a song with a very heavy, picked bassline
            and to capture the textures and heaviness that are usually found in Tool songs.
            It's one of my shortest songs but also probably my favourite.
            I think it represents the sort of music I like to make:
            electronic music with atypical sounds and influences.`,

    title: 'Revolutions',
    info: `With this song, I wanted to write a short song that could be an accompaniment to a scene in a film;
          I tried to capture the vibe of the scene in Lost in Translation when 'Alone in Kyoto' by Air is playing.
          With that in mind, I used a Japanese instrument called the shamisen which I've been playing for
          about 15 years (it's a bit like banjo). I've never heard it used outside of traditional folk music or rock,
          so I've always wanted to use it in a more electronic context.`,

  {
    title: 'Some Days',
    info: `My first song with my own vocals - it took a while to get to this stage, but massive shoutout to
          Luke Robinson for giving me the confidence to go for it. I absolutely love odd time signatures,
          especially if they don't feel like they're in odd time. I always try to make it sound as natural as possible.
          This song starts in 10/8 and then switches to 7/8. The section in 7/8 has been around for a long time
          and gone through many different iterations. It's a nod to the Latin-style beats found in songs like
          'Maria Maria' by Santana and 'Beautiful Liar' by Beyonc√©/Shakira.`,

    title: 'Sundown',
    info: `My first EP. There is a real mix of songs on here, but all with electronic and organic elements.
          From drum machines processed through whammy pedals, to 10/8 and 15/16 time signatures,
          I wanted to create electronic songs with unusual but accessible elements.`,

    title: 'April Tea',
    info: `This song started out on GarageBand with the starting synth arpeggio, kick and guitar in 2018.
          It sat in my hard drive for a few years while I improved my production skills and released my first EP,
          'Sundown', at which point I decided to return to it. After adding the vocal samples and chopping them up,
          the song quickly came together.`,

  {
    title: 'Reflections',
    info: `This song was the first song I ever released. Although it's quite rough in sound compared to my later
          releases, it was an important release for me as it was the first time I had to think seriously about
          mixing and producing.`,

  {
    title: 'Later',
    info: `There were two things I wanted to achieve with this song:
          I wanted to write a dance song in 3/4, and I wanted to use a 303, but in a different way to a lot of songs
          that have a 303 in them (in my opinion, a lot of songs with 303 are 'dark' sounding songs).
          I took a lot of inspiration from 'dreamy' bands like the XX and Night Tapes for the overall soundscape.
          The b-side track, 'Close Your Eyes', takes a synth part from another song of mine as it's main motif.`,
